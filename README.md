# AngularPizzaCo

### Simple website where you can put the pizza you want in the card, order it, and see when it will arrive, all presented in a clean and simple way. This app is a copy of Fast React Pizza Co. made using Angular version 17.2.0

## Features
* NgRx is used in combination with Angular for state managment

* A list of pizzas you can put in a cart and there you can decide if you want to order it

* Geolocation API for getting your current location so the order can be "delivered"

* Easy way to add the count on the pizzas you have put on the cart either on the menu or the cart itself

* Easy way to remove the pizzas from the cart

* Responsive design for mobile phones, tablets, laptops and monitors.

## Techology stack
* For starting the Angular app - Angular CLI
* For UI state managment - NgRx
* For routing - @angular/router
* For styling - Tailwind

 ###!Note:
 The app is made with a remote API, so if the API stops working or changes its URL, the app wont work too.
